// The Center widget in Flutter is a widget that aligns its single child 
// to the center of the parent widget.

// Here's an example of how to use the Center widget in Flutter:

Center(
  child: Text("Hello Center"),
)

// In this example, the Center widget takes a single child, 
// which is a Text widget that displays the text "Hello Center". 
// The Center widget aligns this Text widget to the center of the parent widget, 
// which could be the screen or another widget that contains this Center widget.
