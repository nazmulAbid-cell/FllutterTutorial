// ListTile is a widget in Flutter that is commonly used in lists. 
// It displays a combination of text, icons, and other widgets. 
// It provides a consistent look and feel for items in a list, and makes it easy to create responsive and well-designed list items.

// The ListTile widget can be included in a ListView using a ListView.builder constructor. 
// The ListView.builder constructor creates a scrolling list of widgets that are built on demand. 
// The builder function is called with an index for each item, and the builder should return a ListTile widget for each item in the list.

// Here's an example of how you can use the ListTile widget within a ListView.builder:

less
Copy code
ListView.builder(
  itemCount: items.length,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return ListTile(
      title: Text(items[index]),
      leading: Icon(Icons.check),
      trailing: Icon(Icons.keyboard_arrow_right),
    );
  },
)
// In this example, items is a list of strings that represents the items in the list. 
// The itemBuilder function creates a ListTile for each item in the list. 
// The title property sets the text for each item, the leading property sets an icon to the left of the text, 
// and the trailing property sets an icon to the right of the text.

// You can customize the ListTile widget by setting different properties, 
// such as the leading and trailing widgets, the title and subtitle text, and the onTap callback to 
// handle user taps on the tile. The ListTile widget provides a convenient way to create consistent and well-designed list items in
